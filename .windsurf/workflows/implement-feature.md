Analyze the feature and implement it.

Follow these steps:

1. Understand the feature described and review requirements for domain concepts.
2. Search the codebase for relevant files and design the implementation following DDD architecture patterns.
3. Implement the feature following DDD architecture patterns, TDD techniques and code style of those github repositories: [title](https://github.com/CodelyTV/aggregates-course/tree/main/08-next_steps/1-design_canvas) and [title](https://github.com/CodelyTV/domain_modeling-errors-course/tree/main/09-our_take).
4. Run tests to verify the feature is working as expected.
5. Review the feature and identify refactoring opportunities one all the test are in green.
6. Implement refactoring if needed keeping functionality.
7. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
8. Make a commit following [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) to deliver the feature. The commit must be deployable to production ready.
